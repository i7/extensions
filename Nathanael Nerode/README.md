The "master" branch of this directory contains extensions for use with the most recent development version of Inform (10.2).
The "10.1" branch contains extensions for use with the 10.1 version of Inform.

Some of these are based on extensions by Andrew Plotkin; Andrew Plotkin has stated that his extensions are also under the same CC-BY license.
